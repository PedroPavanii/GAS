## Conclusion:
Based on the analyzes carried out, we assume a relative increase in cases of attacks from the 1990s onwards. In addition to this unfutable hypothesis, I leave the following points to be considered below: The database used is international, and closer follow-up may be restricted. I need the cases, in view of the likely graphic feed based on cases that are reported in the international press. Understanding the limitation of the data, since the start date of records starts in the 80's very close to the date of works that this study proposes to analyze. There is a need for more robust and local data to complement the analysis.
