# The impact of the price of LPG for the needy population in relation to the minimum wage. An analysis from 2013 to 2023.

# Project status(Active)

# Project objective:
### The price of cooking gas, when it represents a high percentage in relation to the minimum wage, can have a more severe impact on the low-income population, who dedicate a larger portion of their wages to buying gas.

## Conclusion:
Based on the insights presented about GLP, we can conclude that there is a large discrepancy in the collection of ICMS in the different Brazilian states, with Minas Gerais being the state that has the most discrepant rate from the others. While some states have increased their taxes over the years, Minas Gerais has remained at the same rate. Despite this, in 2013, the state of Acre charged the highest added value in the price of LPG, while over the 10 years studied, the state that charged the most was Mato Grosso and the cheapest was Bahia. The Northeast region stood out as the most expensive in Brazil in relation to the price of LPG. The hypothesis that cooking gas represented a large margin of the minimum wage was refuted, and over the 10 years, it represented a margin of 6 to 9%, always readjusted according to the annual readjustment of the minimum wage. However, there was a significant increase of 8 to 9% in 2021 and 2022, which indicates the need for continuous monitoring to verify the stabilization or depreciation of rates in the coming years.
